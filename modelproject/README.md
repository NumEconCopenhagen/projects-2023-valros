# Model analysis project

This project was made by, Alon Clausen, Johan Ã˜lgaard, and Valdemar Guldager

Our project is titled **The Solow Model Exhaustible Ressources** and is a simulation of the Solow Model with a limited exhaustible ressources e.g., oil. We demonstrate that the Solow model, when not accounting for an exhaustible resource, achieves a steady state more quickly and reaches a higher equilibrium compared to the version of the model that includes such a resource. We also found that overly depending on a finite resource can hinder the model's ability to reach a steady-state.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb), model code is defined in [modelproject.py](modelproject.py)

**Dependencies:** The following instalations are required to run the code:
- ```scipy```
- ```numpy```
- ```pandas``` 
- ```matplotlib```
- ```ipywidgets```
- ```sympy```
- ```time```
- ```types```
- ```IPython```
