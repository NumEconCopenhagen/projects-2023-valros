# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow Model Exhaustible Ressources** and is a simulation of the Solow Model with an exhaustible ressources e.g., oil. We are aware that the project is not finished yet. We have been quiet busy with writing and defending our Bachelor's Theses. Further to what is created, we miss writing explanatory text, and make the final nummerical solutions and simulations include a widget such that the reader can change parameter values.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb), model code is defined in [modelproject.py](modelproject.py)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
